## 🚨 Important Notes

### Configuration
- **API Base URL**: `https://www.shltechent.com/api`
- **Admin Key**: `currex-admin-123` (in backend .env)
- **Polling Interval**: 30 seconds
- **Backend Port**: 4000

### Current Data
- **Latest Rate**: Buy=815, Sell=633
- **History Count**: 6 rates
- **All rates accessible**: Via API endpoints

### Known Behavior
- History shows only **past** rates (current rate excluded)
- If backend has only 1 rate, history will be empty (normal)
- Polling logs appear every 30s (normal, can be removed in production)
- First load may take 1-2 seconds (fetching from backend)

## 🎯 Final Status

**✅ EVERYTHING IS WORKING!**

The currency exchanger is now:
- ✅ Connected to backend database
- ✅ Syncing across all browsers
- ✅ Updating automatically every 30 seconds
- ✅ Storing history properly
- ✅ Ready for production deployment

**Backend has 6 rates ready for testing!**

**Next step**: Build and deploy frontend to production
```bash
cd /root/shltechent/burmese-thai-currency-exchanger
npm run build
# Deploy dist/ folder
```

## 📞 Support

If anything isn't working:
1. Check browser console for logs (F12)
2. Check Network tab for API calls
3. Run test script: `bash /root/shltechent/test-currex-api.sh`
4. Check backend logs
5. Verify backend is running: `curl https://www.shltechent.com/api/health`

All logs are prefixed with `[API]` or `[Hook]` for easy filtering! 🔍
